   Used within forms to send data to the server.  
   Example:
   ```html
   <form action="/submit-data" method="post">
     <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name">
     <input type="submit" value="Submit">
   </form>
   ```

   - Purpose: Clicking "Submit" sends form data to the server.
