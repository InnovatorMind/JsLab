That's completely okay! Objects can feel a bit tricky at first, but with practice, you'll get the hang of them. How about we start with some fundamental exercises and concepts to build your confidence? Here's what we can do:

1. **Practice Simple Objects**:
   Let's work on creating objects, adding keys and values, and accessing them:
   ```javascript
   const person = {};
   person.name = "John"; // Add a key-value pair
   person.age = 30; // Add another
   console.log(person.name); // Access the value of "name"
   console.log(person.age); // Access the value of "age"
   ```

2. **Explore Loops with Objects**:
   Practice iterating over objects using `for...in`:
   ```javascript
   const car = {
     brand: "Toyota",
     model: "Corolla",
     year: 2021
   };

   for (let key in car) {
     console.log(`${key}: ${car[key]}`); // Prints key and value
   }
   ```

3. **Hands-On Problem**:
   Try creating a small program! For example:
   - Create an object to store details of a book (title, author, pages, etc.).
   - Add and access these details.
   - Extend it with nested objects, like publisher details.
