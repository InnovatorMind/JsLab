Throttling is a technique in JavaScript used to **limit how often a function can run over time**, especially during high-frequency events like scrolling, resizing, or mouse movement.

### ðŸ§  Throttling vs Debouncing

| Feature        | Throttling                              | Debouncing                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Trigger Style  | Executes at regular intervals            | Executes after a pause in activity       |
| Use Case       | Scroll, mousemove, resize                | Input fields, search suggestions         |
| Timing         | Fixed rate (e.g., every 200ms)           | Waits until user stops triggering event  |


### ðŸ§© Why Use Throttling?

- Improves performance by **reducing function calls**
- Prevents UI lag during **intense user interactions**
- Keeps animations and updates **smooth and predictable**

### ðŸ§  Core Use Cases for Throttling

#### 1. **Scroll Events**
- **Why**: Scrolling can trigger hundreds of events per second.
- **Use**: Throttle scroll handlers to update UI (e.g., sticky headers, lazy loading) at a manageable rate.

#### 2. **Resize Events**
- **Why**: Window resizing fires continuously as the user drags.
- **Use**: Throttle layout recalculations or responsive adjustments to avoid performance bottlenecks.

#### 3. **Mouse Movement**
- **Why**: Mousemove events are extremely frequent.
- **Use**: Throttle tracking logic (e.g., tooltips, drawing apps) to reduce CPU load.

#### 4. **Drag-and-Drop Interfaces**
- **Why**: Drag events can overwhelm rendering logic.
- **Use**: Throttle position updates to keep animations smooth and responsive.

#### 5. **Infinite Scroll / Pagination**
- **Why**: Users may scroll rapidly through content.
- **Use**: Throttle data fetching to avoid flooding the server with requests.

#### 6. **Analytics and Logging**
- **Why**: You donâ€™t want to log every tiny interaction.
- **Use**: Throttle event tracking to capture meaningful data without noise.

### ðŸ§© Theoretical Benefits

- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces CPU and memory usage.
- **Network Efficiency**: Limits API calls and bandwidth consumption.
- **User Experience**: Prevents UI lag and janky behavior.
- **Predictable Timing**: Ensures consistent updates at fixed intervals.
