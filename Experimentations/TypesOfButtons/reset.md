The reset button (`<input type="reset">`) is not as commonly used as other buttons like "Submit" or "Click Me!" in modern web development. However, it does have its specific use cases, especially in forms where users might need to clear all input fields and start over. Here are a few places where you might still find it:

1. **Online Surveys or Questionnaires**:  
   If users fill out a form but make a mistake, the "Reset" button provides a quick way to clear all fields and re-enter information.

2. **Admin or Backend Tools**:  
   For tools where forms are frequently reused (e.g., database searches or record management), a reset button might save time by clearing previous inputs.

3. **Demo Forms or Training Websites**:  
   In websites teaching web development or showcasing form functionality, reset buttons might appear as an example of form input types.

4. **Legacy Systems**:  
   Older websites might still rely on reset buttons as part of their user interface.

That said, in modern user-centric design, reset buttons are often avoided because accidentally clicking one can erase all the user's entered data. Instead, developers may provide an "Undo" option or a clear button for individual fields to improve user experience.
