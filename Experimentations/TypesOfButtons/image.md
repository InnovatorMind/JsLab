An **image button** in HTML is a button created using the `<input type="image">` element. It uses an image as its clickable button, typically for form submission, offering a visually appealing alternative to the plain text-based submit button. Let me break it down with examples:

### **What Does an Image Button Do?**
When clicked, it works just like a submit button, sending the form data to the server specified in the `action` attribute of the `<form>` tag. However, it also submits the `x` and `y` coordinates of the click relative to the image.

### **Example of an Image Button**

```html
<form action="/submit-data" method="post">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name">
  
  <!-- Image button -->
  <input type="image" src="submit-button.png" alt="Submit" width="150">
</form>
```

#### **Explanation:**
1. **The Image**: The `src="submit-button.png"` points to the image file used as the button.
2. **Coordinates**: When the user clicks on the image, the browser submits additional data (`x` and `y` values) indicating where the image was clicked.
3. **Form Submission**: The form sends all data, including the image click's coordinates, to the server.

### **Where Is an Image Button Used?**
1. **Custom Form Submission**: Image buttons are used when you want a visually engaging submit button instead of plain text.
2. **Interactive Maps or Graphics**: In applications where clicking different areas of an image triggers specific actions.
3. **Creative Contact Forms**: Adds a professional, branded look to forms, aligning with a website's theme.

### **Styling an Image Button**
You can control its appearance with attributes like `width` and `height`, or use CSS for advanced styling:
```html
<form action="/submit-data" method="post">
  <input type="image" src="submit-button.png" alt="Submit" style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 8px;">
</form>
```

This adds a border and rounded corners to the image button.
