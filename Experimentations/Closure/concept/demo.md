## 🧠 What actually “gets attached” in a closure?

When a function forms a **closure**,
it doesn’t copy the *value* of variables from its outer scope —
instead, it keeps a **reference** to those variables in memory.

So, when you say “what kind of value gets attached,”
the answer is:
👉 **Any variable (primitive or non-primitive)** that the inner function *uses* from its outer scope.

Let’s see how it behaves with different types 👇

---

## 🧩 1. Primitive values (like `number`, `string`, `boolean`)

They are **attached by reference to the variable**, not by value.
Meaning — if the inner function changes the variable, it changes for real.

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0; // primitive
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

✅ The closure “remembers” the same `count` variable —
even though it’s a primitive.

---

## 🧩 2. Object values

Objects are **reference types**, so the closure holds a reference to the **same object** in memory.

```js
function outer() {
  let user = { name: "Alice", age: 20 };
  return function() {
    user.age++;
    return user;
  };
}

const updateUser = outer();
console.log(updateUser()); // { name: 'Alice', age: 21 }
console.log(updateUser()); // { name: 'Alice', age: 22 }
```

✅ The same `user` object is being updated each time.
The closure keeps access to the **original object**, not a copy.

---

## 🧩 3. Arrays

Same story as objects — arrays are **reference types**, so closures keep the same array instance.

```js
function outer() {
  let arr = [];
  return function(value) {
    arr.push(value);
    return arr;
  };
}

const addItem = outer();
console.log(addItem(10)); // [10]
console.log(addItem(20)); // [10, 20]
```

✅ Each call modifies the *same* `arr` because it’s referenced in the closure.

---

## 🧩 4. Functions

Even functions can be captured inside closures, since in JavaScript functions are first-class objects.

```js
function outer() {
  const greet = () => "Hello!";
  return function() {
    return greet();
  };
}

const sayHello = outer();
console.log(sayHello()); // "Hello!"
```

✅ The closure remembers the `greet` function and can call it later.

---

### ⚡ So in summary:

| Type      | Example         | Behavior in closure              |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Primitive | `let x = 1`     | Keeps reference to variable      |
| Object    | `{}`            | Keeps reference to same object   |
| Array     | `[]`            | Keeps reference to same array    |
| Function  | `function() {}` | Keeps reference to same function |

---

But let’s go through **every data type** JavaScript has — and check which ones can be part of a closure 👇

---

## 🧩 JavaScript Data Types (Complete List)

JavaScript has **7 primitive types** and **1 non-primitive (object)** type.

| Category          | Data Type   | Example                                  | Can be captured in closure? | Notes                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primitive**     | `number`    | `let n = 5`                              | ✅ Yes                       | Captured by variable reference                     |
|                   | `string`    | `"Hello"`                                | ✅ Yes                       | Works same as number                               |
|                   | `boolean`   | `true`                                   | ✅ Yes                       | Works same as number                               |
|                   | `null`      | `null`                                   | ✅ Yes                       | Just a fixed value, but closure can still store it |
|                   | `undefined` | `undefined`                              | ✅ Yes                       | Can be remembered, though useless                  |
|                   | `symbol`    | `Symbol("id")`                           | ✅ Yes                       | Still captured by reference                        |
|                   | `bigint`    | `123n`                                   | ✅ Yes                       | Like number, just larger integers                  |
| **Non-Primitive** | `object`    | `{}`, `[]`, `function(){}`, `new Date()` | ✅ Yes                       | All reference types                                |

---

So closures can actually hold **any** of these types —
because what gets captured is the **variable binding**, not the “kind” of value.

Let’s check some uncommon ones:

---

### 🧠 Example: Symbol

```js
function outer() {
  const secret = Symbol("hidden");
  return function() {
    return secret;
  };
}

const getSecret = outer();
console.log(getSecret() === getSecret()); // true (same symbol reference)
```

✅ Closure remembers the same Symbol reference.

---

### 🧠 Example: BigInt

```js
function outer() {
  let big = 1000000000000000000n;
  return function() {
    big *= 2n;
    return big;
  };
}

const doubleBig = outer();
console.log(doubleBig()); // 2000000000000000000n
console.log(doubleBig()); // 4000000000000000000n
```

✅ Closure can even hold BigInts — no problem.

---

### 🧠 Example: Date or Map (special object types)

```js
function outer() {
  const map = new Map();
  return function(key, value) {
    map.set(key, value);
    return map;
  };
}

const addToMap = outer();
console.log(addToMap("x", 10)); // Map { 'x' => 10 }
console.log(addToMap("y", 20)); // Map { 'x' => 10, 'y' => 20 }
```

✅ Works perfectly, because it’s still just a reference object.

---

Closures can “attach” (i.e., keep alive) **any kind of value** —
because what’s captured is not the **value**, but the **variable binding** in the outer scope.
So whether that variable holds a:

* Primitive (like number, string, boolean, etc.)
* Object
* Array
* Function
* Special object (like `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, etc.)
* Or even `null` / `undefined`

…it all stays accessible through the closure 🔒
