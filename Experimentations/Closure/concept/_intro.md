## 🧠 What Is a Closure?

A **closure** is a function that “remembers” the variables from its **outer scope**, even after that outer function has finished executing.

### 🔍 Basic Example

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
  return inner;
}

const counter = outer(); // outer runs, returns inner
counter(); // logs: 1
counter(); // logs: 2
```

Even though `outer()` has finished, `inner()` still remembers `count`. That’s a closure.

## 🧱 Breaking It Down

### 1. **Lexical Scope**
JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, meaning a function’s scope is determined by where it’s defined in the code.

```js
function outer() {
  let name = "Anonymous";
  function inner() {
    console.log(name); // has access to outer's variable
  }
  inner();
}
```

### 2. **Function + Environment = Closure**
When a function is returned or passed around, it carries its **environment** (the variables it had access to when it was created).

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

### ✅ Data Privacy

```js
function createSecret(secret) {
  return function revealSecret() {
    console.log(`The secret is: ${secret}`);
  };
}

const mySecret = createSecret("I love closures");
mySecret(); // logs: The secret is: I love closures
```

### ✅ Function Factories

```js
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function(x) {
    return x * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

### ✅ Event Handlers

```js
function setupButton(id) {
  let count = 0;
  document.getElementById(id).addEventListener("click", function () {
    count++;
    console.log(`Clicked ${count} times`);
  });
}
```

## 🧠 Deep Dive: Closure vs Scope vs Execution Context

| Concept             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Scope**           | Where variables are accessible |
| **Execution Context** | The environment in which code runs (includes scope, `this`, etc.) |
| **Closure**         | A function + its remembered scope |

Closures are created **automatically** when functions are returned or passed around.

## 🧨 Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Loop + Closure Trap

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); // logs: 3, 3, 3
}
```

### ✅ Fix with `let`

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); // logs: 0, 1, 2
}
```

## 🧘‍♂️ Closure Meditation: Think Like the Engine

When you return a function, JavaScript doesn’t just return the code—it returns the **function + its memory**. That memory is the closure.
