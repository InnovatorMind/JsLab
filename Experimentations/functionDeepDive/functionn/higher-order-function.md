A **Higher-Order Function (HOF)** is a function that does at least **one** of these:

1. **Takes another function as an argument**
2. **Returns a function as its result**

This concept exists only because the language supports **first-class functions** (otherwise you couldnâ€™t pass/return them).

### ðŸ”¹ Example in JavaScript

**Takes a function as argument:**

```js
function applyOperation(a, b, operation) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

const sum = (x, y) => x + y;
const product = (x, y) => x * y;

console.log(applyOperation(5, 3, sum));     // 8
console.log(applyOperation(5, 3, product)); // 15
```

**Returns a function:**

```js
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function(x) {
    return x * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

### ðŸ”¹ Built-in Higher-Order Functions

Many languages have them built in:

* **JavaScript** â†’ `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const squares = numbers.map(n => n * n); // [1, 4, 9]
```

* **Python** â†’ `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted(key=...)`

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
squares = list(map(lambda x: x*x, numbers))  # [1, 4, 9]
```

---

âœ… **In short:**

* **First-class function** = functions are treated like values (you can pass/return them).
* **Higher-order function** = a function that *uses* functions as input/output.
